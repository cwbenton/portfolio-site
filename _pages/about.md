My name is Connor Benton, and I am a first-year MS student in Data Science and Analytics at Kennesaw State University. I recently completed a BS in Mathematics with a concentration in Statistics at Kennesaw State. My academic and professional interests lie in non-parametric statistical methods and their applications in data science, particularly in modern American politics. 

As a data-driven individual, I enjoy tackling challenging problems and devising solutions mathematically. Currently, I intern at the Federal Burau of Investigation in Atlanta, where I leverage data to assist with casework. Additionally, I lecture on mathematics, data science, and statistics, hoping to share my passion for these fields with others. Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I enjoy running, reading, playing the piano, and Linux! You can explore some of my projects and contributions on my page.
